start with two folders,
Input - The collection of media fresh out of takeout
Output - the folder that the media will be filed into.

iterate through every non json file,

get the accompanying json file

get the timestamp from the json file

set the modified date based on this timestamp
move and rename the file

if a file with the same name exists, do a MD5 compare to identify if they
are unique.

if the files are different, number them.

move each file into a directory named after its year any month,
for example a photo from april 2021 would be placed in Output/2021/04
